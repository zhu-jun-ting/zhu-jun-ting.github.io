	<p>
		After a brief negotiation with Curtis and Santiago Lyon, the Director of Photography for the AP, Curtis and I talked at length about the Mickey Mouse photograph and that entire day in Tyre, Lebanon, the day the Mickey Mouse photograph was taken. It was my attempt to put the photograph in context, or, if you prefer, to write an elaborate caption for it.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		I was curious about the exact location of the photographs. And so I attempted to pinpoint the location on a map. There are a series of UN reconnaissance maps and photographs[3][4]. I sent them to Ben Curtis and asked him to identify where the Mickey Mouse was found.
