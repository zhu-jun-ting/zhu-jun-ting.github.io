			This does appear to be the same as the location of the 
			<a href="interview.html">
				Mickey Mouse incident
			</a>
			. I couldn’t say 100%, but it’s in pretty much the correct area and the layout, particularly the green area to the left of the buildings makes sense. That green area is I think seen on

				far left of the “truck” photo

			The hospital (from which I took the photo of the smoke from the buildings) is a small way down a side street on the right of the road that leads from 
			<a href="military.html">
				Tyre center to the buildings site
			</a>
			, but I couldn’t pinpoint it exactly… We didn’t have any maps then, I’d only recognize it from 
			<a href="index.html">
