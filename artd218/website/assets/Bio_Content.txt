I consider myself to be a passionate community servant with the bility to motivate and inspire individuals in identifying their potential to continue and share this passion to serve others. With this ongoing quest to give, I have been able to promote significant, positive change in communities and individuals through advocacy, empowered by compassion. I take pride in engaging in a civically based approached to design. As a South Bronx native and son of a Dominican born single mother, I have grown to be familiar with a striving through strife mindset based on a strong foundation built on educational values. These brief but significant attributes have naturally inspired me to become a voice to the voiceless and a beacon of hope to the hopeless.
