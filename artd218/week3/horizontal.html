						He was born in Bucaramanga, the capital of Santander Department. At the age of 16, he
						traveled to the United States to study fine arts at Boston University, where he graduated cum laude. He then went
						to Yale University, where he graduated with highest marks in 1963 and was made a professor. He worked with Paul
						Rand at his New York studio.

						Universidad Nacional (where he was designated professor emeritus in 1991) and Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano,
						where he founded the first graphic design studies program at a Colombian university in 1967. However, he
						participated in Universidad Nacional's advertising design contests in 1966, 1977, and 1982, which changed his
						career path to being a graphic designer.
