						Where do we find our dogs?
						o Pet adoption usually refers to the process of taking guardianship of and
						responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or released to a
						shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are:
					</p>

					<ul>

						<li class="content-text-point">
							Animal shelters, in the case of dogs also known as dog pound.
							</li>

						<li class="content-text-point">
							Pets found loose or stray without identification, and which are unclaimed
							by any owner.
							</li>

						<li class="content-text-point">
							Advertisements placed by individuals trying to find a new home for their
							pet.
							</li>

						<li class="content-text-point">
							Pets that have been abused or neglected and have been confiscated from
							the offending owner.
							</li>

						<li class="content-text-point">
							Dogs adopted from shelters are often referred to as shelter dogs or pound
							puppies; dogs adopted from rescue organizations are often called rescued
							dogs or rescue dogs.
							</li>

					</ul>

					<p>
						We strive to provide the best care for the animals in our program, and we
						include MORE in our adoption fees than many small, no-kill rescues. When
						considering adoption, please check into what is included in the adoption fees.
						We hold all animals in our care for a minimum of 21 days to properly screen
						for health conditions, and to provide as much pre-adoption care as possible.
