					<h4>Our Story</h4>
					<p>
						Animal shelters care for animals needing protection, attempt to find homes for homeless animals,
						and reunite lost pets with their owners. When necessary, animal shelters give homeless or
						unadoptable animals a humane death. Today’s shelters range from single rooms with multiple
						cages to state-of-the-art facilities with amenities that may rival some hotels. The “luxury”
						features, like ambient music and waterfalls, serve to reduce the animals’ stress and to make the
						shelter more inviting, which increases the chances that the animals at the shelter will find a new
						home.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Animal shelters can be structured in three ways. First, as municipal animal control agencies, run
						by city or county governments; second, as non-profit agencies overseen by a board of directors;
						or third, as private, non-profit agencies with a government contract to provide animal control
						services.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Private, non-profit organizations rely on donations and grants to fund their programs. Many
						private agencies are limited-access, sometimes called “no-kill” facilities, because they do not
						euthanize animals to make room for more animals. At times, they find it necessary to turn
						animals that are brought to them away if they do not have available space. To solve this problem,
						municipal and private agencies set up foster-care networks to increase the number of animals
						they can serve at a given point in time.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Shelters, both municipal and private, may provide other services to the public if they have
						sufficient resources. These services may include animal health services, such as exams and
						spay/neuter surgeries, behavioral evaluations and training, humane education, and others.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Any shelter can use the term “Humane Society” or “SPCA” in their name. SPCA stands for
						Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. These are generic terms that do not imply the
						shelter is part of a larger organization or has special powers. In fact, most humane societies and
						SPCA's are independent agencies. National organizations do not have any oversight or governing
						power over these independent agencies; however, national organizations offer suggested
						guidelines and recommendations for animal shelters, which are often followed (Fekety 1998).
